# Task

You've learned how to code a custom hook in React. In this code lab, you'll practice writing a brand new custom hook.

The starter code for this app contains code that will display the day of the week within an h1 heading, for example: "Today is: Monday". 
There is also a button under this heading, that reads "Get next day".

When a user clicks on this button, the h1 heading updates so that the message shows the next day in the sequence.

Your task is to complete the custom hook named usePrevious so that the h1 heading shows both the current day and the previous current day before the update.

Note: Before you begin, make sure you understand how to work with the Coursera Code Lab for the 
Advanced React course
.

Note: Use npm start to get the starting version of the app running in the browser.
